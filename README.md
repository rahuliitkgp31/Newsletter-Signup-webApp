# [Newsletter-signup-webapp](https://agile-sands-87711.herokuapp.com/)
This is a Newsletter signup webapp where user can signup with his/her name and email. The information is send to [mailchimps](https://mailchimp.com/)
servers through their APIs and gets stored there. I can access this information through my mail chimp account. I created this app as a part of learning APIs

This app is created from scratch by using [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) framework, [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) module, [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) HTTP client module for backend and by using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for Frontend
