# [Newsletter-signup-webapp](https://agile-sands-87711.herokuapp.com/)
This is a Newsletter signup app where user can signup with his/her name, email and that information gets sent and stored on [mailchimps](https://mailchimp.com/)
servers through their APIs where I can access it through my mail chimp account. I created this app as a part of learning APIs
<br/>
This app is created from scratch by using [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) framework, [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) module, [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) HTTP client module for backend and by using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for Frontend
<br/>
I deployed this on heroku and it is live [click here](https://agile-sands-87711.herokuapp.com/) to see it.
